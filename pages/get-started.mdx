# Get Started

## Setup 

### Install `ko`

See [Install](./install), if you haven't done this yet.

### Authenticate

`ko` depends on the authentication configured in your Docker config (typically `~/.docker/config.json`).

✨ **If you can push an image with `docker push`, you are already authenticated for `ko`!** ✨

Since `ko` doesn't require `docker`, `ko login` also provides a surface for logging in to a container image registry with a username and password, similar to `docker login`.

Additionally, even if auth is not configured in the Docker config, `ko` includes built-in support for authenticating to the following container registries using credentials configured in the environment:

Google Container Registry and Artifact Registry
  - using [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production) or auth configured in `gcloud`.

Amazon Elastic Container Registry
  - using [AWS credentials](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper/#aws-credentials)

Azure Container Registry
  - using [environment variables](https://github.com/chrismellard/docker-credential-acr-env/)

GitHub Container Registry
  - using the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable

### Choose Destination

`ko` depends on an environment variable, `KO_DOCKER_REPO`, to identify where it should push images that it builds. Typically this will be a remote registry, e.g.:

- `KO_DOCKER_REPO=gcr.io/my-project`, or
- `KO_DOCKER_REPO=ghcr.io/my-org/my-repo`, or
- `KO_DOCKER_REPO=my-dockerhub-user`
