# Limitations

`ko` works best when your application has no dependencies on the underlying image.

This means `ko` is ideal when you don't require [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo), and builds ar executed with `CGO_ENABLED=0` by default.

To install other OS packages, make those available in your [configured base image](./../configuration).
