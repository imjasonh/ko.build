# [ko.build](https://ko.build)

This repo holds the content, config and code for the documentation website for [`ko`](https://github.com/google/ko), at https://ko.build.

## Development

Update `.md` files to update content.

Update `mkdocs.yml` to update sidebar headers and ordering.

To run locally, [install `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/) and run `mkdocs serve`.

This will start a local server on localhost:3000 that autoupdates as you make changes.
