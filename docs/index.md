# Introduction

`ko` makes building Go container images easy, fast, and secure by default.

`ko` is a simple, fast container image builder for Go applications.

It's ideal for use cases where your image contains a single Go application without many dependencies on the OS base image (e.g., no cgo, no OS package dependencies).

`ko` builds images by executing `go build` on your local machine, and as such doesn't require `docker` to be installed.
This can make it a good fit for lightweight CI/CD use cases.

`ko` also includes support for simple YAML templating which makes it a powerful tool for [Kubernetes applications](./features/k8s).
